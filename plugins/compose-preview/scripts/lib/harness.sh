# Shared harness selection for compose-preview hooks.

# Generated hook commands must pass --harness=<name>. Environment detection is
# only a compatibility fallback.

# Stop-hook output contracts:
# - Claude Code: {"decision":"block","reason":...} keeps the agent working.
# - Codex: the same shape. Checked against codex-rs/hooks
#   schema/generated/stop.command.output.schema.json (openai/codex 67a7096),
#   which also sends stop_hook_active on input. A live Codex turn has not yet
#   observed a block (issue #6 Q4).
# - Antigravity: {"decision":"continue","reason":...}, a capped nudge.

# Sets HARNESS to one of: antigravity, claude, codex, opencode, gemini, unknown.
# An explicit --harness=<name> takes precedence over environment detection.
# Returns 2 for an invalid argument or an unsupported explicit harness.
